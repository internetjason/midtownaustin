                <p class="lead">Jesus is the most generous person who ever lived. He gave his life so that we might live. As Christians, we give our time, talent, and money joyfully in response to Jesus’ generosity and to help more people meet Jesus.</p>

                <p>As a community, we take joy in the ways our faith is made stronger through giving and receiving together. There is a satisfaction that comes from following Jesus’ example of generosity toward those most in need, and it is a privilege to use our resources and time to continue telling God’s story and help bring measurable change in the world.</p>

                <p>Below are some ways for you to give to the ministry of Midtown Church.</p>

                <p>If you’ve been served by Midtown Church, whether it be through greeters on Sundays, teachers in you child’s classroom, enjoying a cup of coffee before service, musicians on stage leading us in worship, or any number of other ways—chances are you’ve been served by a faithful volunteer giving up time and talent to serve Jesus by serving you. At Midtown, we intentionally keep our budget and staff small and rely on a community of volunteers who love Jesus and love to serve his church.</p>
                <p>If you consider Midtown your church, we ask you to serve as a volunteer. By doing so, you’re an essential part of helping others meet Jesus. And if you’re a member, you’ve committed to serve generously as part of your membership covenant.</p>
                <p>There are a number of opportunities to serve at Midtown. To find out how you can serve, contact Adam Brunson at adam@midtownaustin.org</p>
