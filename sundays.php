                <h3>What to Expect</h3>
                <p>When you get there, grab some coffee and meet someone or just head right into the auditorium. Knowing that Jesus has truly paid it all for us helps our worship environment have a relaxed and casual feel. We will sing some songs, hear a sermon about Jesus from the Bible, take communion, and say a few prayers. Thatâ€™s about it! We welcome all people to join with us in our Sunday celebration of Jesus.</p>

                <h3>What About Kids?</h3>
                <p>While you are in the worship service we have fun and engaging classes for kids (nursery through elementary school) that will help them worship God according to their age level. We will always let you know what is being taught and classes are always optional.</p>
                <p>We invite all middle school and high school students to worship with the adults.</p>
